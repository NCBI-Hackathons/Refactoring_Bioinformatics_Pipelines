= Docker container

The pipline needs the following tools:

- https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/[Picard Tools]
- https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/[Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK)]
- https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR[STAR] - RNA mapper
- http://www.htslib.org/[samtools]
- http://cran.r-project.org[R]

A Docker container with all tools except the Genome Analysis Toolkit can be built from the `Dockerfile` present in this folder.

A prebuilt Docker container is available at the Docker hub as `cbcrg/ngs2017ws-nf`.

For the Genome Analysis Toolkit we use `biodckrdev/gatk` available at the Docker hub.
